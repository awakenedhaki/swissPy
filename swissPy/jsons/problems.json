The advantage with the XOR function is that using the same encryption key on the cipher text, restores the plain text; for example, 65 XOR 42 = 107, then 107 XOR 42 = 65.\nFor unbreakable encryption, the key is the same length as the plain text message, and the key is made up of random bytes. The user would keep the encrypted message and the encryption key in different locations, and without both \"halves\", it is impossible to decrypt the message.\nUnfortunately, this method is impractical for most users, so the modified method is to use a password as a key. If the password is shorter than the message, which is likely, the key is repeated cyclically throughout the message. The balance for this method is using a sufficiently long password key for security, but short enough to be memorable.\nYour task has been made easy, as the encryption key consists of three lower case characters.

Instead they proceed directly to jail.\nAt the beginning of the game, the CC and CH cards are shuffled. When a player lands on CC or CH they take a card from the top of the respective pile and, after following the instructions, it is returned to the bottom of the pile.

A dart landing outside the red/green outer ring scores zero. The black and cream regions inside this ring represent single scores. However, the red/green outer ring and middle ring score double and treble scores respectively.\nAt the centre of the board are two concentric circles called the bull region, or bulls-eye. The outer bull is worth 25 points and the inner bull is a double, worth 50 points.\nThere are many variations of rules but in the most popular game the players will begin with a score 301 or 501 and the first player to reduce their running total to zero is a winner. However, it is normal to play a \"doubles out\" system, which means that the player must land a double (including the double bulls-eye at the centre of the board) on their final dart to win; any other dart that would reduce their running total to one or lower means the score for that set of three darts is \"bust\".\nWhen a player is able to finish  on their current score it is called a \"checkout\" and the highest checkout is 170: T20 T20 D25 (two treble 20s and double bull).\nThere are exactly eleven distinct ways to checkout on a score of 6:\n\nD3\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nD1\nD2\n\u00a0\nS2\nD2\n\u00a0\nD2\nD1\n\u00a0\nS4\nD1\n\u00a0\nS1\nS1\nD2\nS1\nT1\nD1\nS1\nS3\nD1\nD1\nD1\nD1\nD1\nS2\nD1\nS2\nS2\nD1\n\nNote that D1 D2 is considered different to D2 D1 as they finish on different doubles.

Number \"8\" lights them all.\nThe clocks consume energy only when segments are turned on/off.\nTo turn on a \"2\" will cost 5 transitions, while a \"7\" will cost only 4 transitions.\nSam and Max built two different clocks.\nSam's clock is fed e.g. number 137: the clock shows \"137\", then the panel is turned off, then the next number (\"11\") is turned on, then the panel is turned off again and finally the last number (\"2\") is turned on and, after some time, off.\nFor the example, with number 137, Sam's clock requires:\"137\"\n:\n(2 + 5 + 4) \u00d7 2 = 22 transitions (\"137\" on/off).\n\"11\"\n:\n(2 + 2) \u00d7 2 = 8 transitions (\"11\" on/off).\n\"2\"\n:\n(5) \u00d7 2 = 10 transitions (\"2\" on/off).\n\nFor a grand total of 40 transitions.\n\nMax's clock works differently. Instead of turning off the whole panel, it is smart enough to turn off only those segments that won't be needed for the next number.\nFor number 137, Max's clock requires:\"137\"\n:\n2 + 5 + 4 = 11 transitions (\"137\" on)\n7 transitions (to turn off the segments that are not needed for number \"11\").\n\"11\"\n:\n0 transitions (number \"11\" is already turned on correctly)\n3 transitions (to turn off the first \"1\" and the bottom part of the second \"1\"; \nthe top part is common with number \"2\").\n\"2\"\n:\n4 transitions (to turn on the remaining segments in order to get a \"2\")\n5 transitions (to turn off number \"2\").\n\nFor a grand total of 30 transitions.\n\nOf course, Max's clock consumes less power than Sam's one.\nThe two clocks are fed all the prime numbers between A = 107 and B = 2\u00d7107. \nFind the difference between the total number of transitions needed by Sam's clock and that needed by Max's one.",

Then,\nIf the result is negative, all the sheep in that group are deemed to be virus-free.\nIf the result is positive, 5 additional tests will be performed (a separate test for each animal) to determine the affected individual(s).\n\nSince the probability of infection for any specific animal is only 0.02, the first test (on the pooled samples) for each group will be:\nNegative (and no more tests needed) with probability 0.985 = 0.9039207968.\nPositive (5 additional tests needed) with probability 1 - 0.9039207968 = 0.0960792032.\n\nThus, the expected number of tests for each group is 1 + 0.0960792032 \u00d7 5 = 1.480396016.\nConsequently, all 5 groups can be screened using an average of only 1.480396016 \u00d7 5 = 7.40198008 tests, which represents a huge saving of more than 70\n\n\nAlthough the scheme we have just described seems to be very efficient, it can still be improved considerably (always assuming that the test is sufficiently sensitive and that there are no adverse effects caused by mixing different samples). E.g.:\nWe may start by running a test on a mixture of all the 25 samples. It can be verified that in about 60.35\nIf we know that at least one animal in a group of 5 is infected and the first 4 individual tests come out negative, there is no need to run a test on the fifth animal (we know that it must be infected).\nWe can try a different number of groups / different number of animals in each group, adjusting those numbers at each level so that the total expected number of tests will be minimised.\n\nTo simplify the very wide range of possibilities, there is one restriction we place when devising the most cost-efficient testing scheme: whenever we start with a mixed sample, all the sheep contributing to that sample must be fully screened (i.e. a verdict of infected / virus-free must be reached for all of them) before we start examining any other animals.\n\nFor the current example, it turns out that the most cost-efficient testing scheme (we'll call it the optimal strategy) requires an average of just 4.155452 tests!\n\n\n\nUsing the optimal strategy, let T(s,p) represent the average number of tests needed to screen a flock of s sheep for a virus having probability p to be present in any individual.\nThus, rounded to six decimal places, T(25, 0.02) = 4.155452 and T(25, 0.10) = 12.702124.\n\n\nFind \u03a3T(10000, p) for p=0.01, 0.02, 0.03, ... 0.50.\nGive your answer rounded to six decimal places.",

It can also be shown that this is the lowest worst-case cost that can be achieved. \nSo, in fact, we have just described an optimal strategy for the given values of n, a, and b.\nLet C(n, a, b) be the worst-case cost achieved by an optimal strategy for the given values of n, a, and b.\nHere are a few examples:\nC(5, 2, 3) = 5\nC(500, \u221a2, \u221a3) = 13.22073197...\nC(20000, 5, 7) = 82\nC(2000000, \u221a5, \u221a7) = 49.63755955...\nLet Fk be the Fibonacci numbers: Fk = Fk-1 + Fk-2 with base cases F1 = F2 = 1.Find \u2211_k = 1^30C  (10^12, \u221a(k), \u221a(F_k) ), and give your answer rounded to 8 decimal places behind the decimal point.",

(The common rules of kakuro puzzles can be found easily on numerous internet sites. Other related information can also be currently found at krazydad.com whose author has provided the puzzle data for this challenge.)\nThe downloadable text file (kakuro200.txt) contains the description of 200 such puzzles, a mix of 5x5 and 6x6 types. The first puzzle in the file is the above example which is coded as follows:\n6,X,X,(vCC),(vI),X,X,X,(hH),B,O,(vCA),(vJE),X,(hFE,vD),O,O,O,O,(hA),O,I,(hJC,vB),O,O,(hJC),H,O,O,O,X,X,X,(hJE),O,O,X\nThe first character is a numerical digit indicating the size of the information grid. It would be either a 6 (for a 5x5 kakuro puzzle) or a 7 (for a 6x6 puzzle) followed by a comma (,). The extra top line and left column are needed to insert information.\nThe content of each cell is then described and followed by a comma, going left to right and starting with the top line.\nX = Gray cell, not required to be filled by a digit.\nO (upper case letter)= White empty cell to be filled by a digit.\nA = Or any one of the upper case letters from A to J to be replaced by its equivalent digit in the solved puzzle.\n( ) = Location of the encrypted sums. Horizontal sums are preceded by a lower case \"h\" and vertical sums are preceded by a lower case \"v\". Those are followed by one or two upper case letters depending if the sum is a single digit or double digit one. For double digit sums, the first letter would be for the \"tens\" and the second one for the \"units\". When the cell must contain information for both a horizontal and a vertical sum, the first one is always for the horizontal sum and the two are separated by a comma within the same set of brackets, ex.: (hFE,vD). Each set of brackets is also immediately followed by a comma.\nThe description of the last cell is followed by a Carriage Return/Line Feed (CRLF) instead of a comma.\nThe required answer to each puzzle is based on the value of each letter necessary to arrive at the solution and according to the alphabetical order. As indicated under the example puzzle, its answer would be 8426039571. At least 9 out of the 10 encrypting letters are always part of the problem description. When only 9 are given, the missing one must be assigned the remaining digit.\nYou are given that the sum of the answers for the first 10 puzzles in the file is 64414157580.\nFind the sum of the answers for the 200 puzzles.",

Quentin, the representative from the company that installed the silo, explains that they only manufacture cylindrical silos, but he points out that it is resting on a square base. Fred is not amused and insists that it is removed from his property.\nQuick thinking Quentin explains that when granular materials are delivered from above a conical slope is formed and the natural angle made with the horizontal is called the angle of repose. For example if the angle of repose, \u03b1 = 30 degrees, and grain is delivered at the centre of the silo then a perfect cone will form towards the top of the cylinder. In the case of this silo, which has a diameter of 6m, the amount of space wasted would be approximately 32.648388556 m3. However, if grain is delivered at a point on the top which has a horizontal distance of x metres from the centre then a cone with a strangely curved and sloping base is formed. He shows Fred a picture.\n\n\nWe shall let the amount of space wasted in cubic metres be given by V(x). If x = 1.114785284, which happens to have three squared decimal places, then the amount of space wasted, V(1.114785284) \u2248 36. Given the range of possible solutions to this problem there is exactly one other option: V(2.511167869) \u2248 49. It would be like knowing that the square is king of the silo, sitting in splendid glory on top of your grain.\nFred's eyes light up with delight at this elegant resolution, but on closer inspection of Quentin's drawings and calculations his happiness turns to despondency once more. Fred points out to Quentin that it's the radius of the silo that is 6 metres, not the diameter, and the angle of repose for his grain is 40 degrees. However, if Quentin can find a set of solutions for this particular silo then he will be more than happy to keep it.\nIf Quick thinking Quentin is to satisfy frustratingly fussy Fred the farmer's appetite for all things square then determine the values of x for all possible square space wastage options and calculate \u2211 x correct to 9 decimal places.",

From P2(3, 3) to B(4, 1) the ant travels at velocity (1 - 3) / (ln(1) - ln(3)) \u2248 1.8205 so the required time is sqrt(5) / 1.8205 \u2248 1.2283.\nThus the total required time is 1.2283 + 0.6667 + 1.2283 = 3.1233.\n\n\nThe right image is another path.

For example, a mixture described by the ratio (2\u00a0:\u00a03\u00a0:\u00a05) contains 20\nFor the purposes of this problem, we cannot separate the individual components from a mixture. However, we can combine different amounts of different mixtures to form mixtures with new ratios.\nFor example, say we have three mixtures with ratios (3\u00a0:\u00a00\u00a0:\u00a02), (3\u00a0:\u00a06\u00a0:\u00a011) and (3\u00a0:\u00a03\u00a0:\u00a04). By mixing 10 units of the first, 20 units of the second and 30 units of the third, we get a new mixture with ratio (6\u00a0:\u00a05\u00a0:\u00a09), since:\n(10\u00b73/5\u00a0+\u00a020\u00b73/20\u00a0+\u00a030\u00b73/10\u00a0:\u00a010\u00b70/5\u00a0+\u00a020\u00b76/20\u00a0+\u00a030\u00b73/10\u00a0:\u00a010\u00b72/5\u00a0+\u00a020\u00b711/20\u00a0+\u00a030\u00b74/10)\n= (18\u00a0:\u00a015\u00a0:\u00a027) = (6\u00a0:\u00a05\u00a0:\u00a09)\nHowever, with the same three mixtures, it is impossible to form the ratio (3\u00a0:\u00a02\u00a0:\u00a01), since the amount of B is always less than the amount of C.\nLet n be a positive integer. Suppose that for every triple of integers (a, b, c) with 0 \u2264 a, b, c \u2264 n and gcd(a, b, c) = 1, we have a mixture with ratio (a\u00a0:\u00a0b\u00a0:\u00a0c). Let M(n) be the set of all such mixtures.\nFor example, M(2) contains the 19 mixtures with the following ratios:\n(0\u00a0:\u00a00\u00a0:\u00a01), (0\u00a0:\u00a01\u00a0:\u00a00), (0\u00a0:\u00a01\u00a0:\u00a01), (0\u00a0:\u00a01\u00a0:\u00a02), (0\u00a0:\u00a02\u00a0:\u00a01), \n(1\u00a0:\u00a00\u00a0:\u00a00), (1\u00a0:\u00a00\u00a0:\u00a01), (1\u00a0:\u00a00\u00a0:\u00a02), (1\u00a0:\u00a01\u00a0:\u00a00), (1\u00a0:\u00a01\u00a0:\u00a01), \n(1\u00a0:\u00a01\u00a0:\u00a02), (1\u00a0:\u00a02\u00a0:\u00a00), (1\u00a0:\u00a02\u00a0:\u00a01), (1\u00a0:\u00a02\u00a0:\u00a02), (2\u00a0:\u00a00\u00a0:\u00a01), \n(2\u00a0:\u00a01\u00a0:\u00a00), (2\u00a0:\u00a01\u00a0:\u00a01), (2\u00a0:\u00a01\u00a0:\u00a02), (2\u00a0:\u00a02\u00a0:\u00a01).\nLet E(n) be the number of subsets of M(n) which can produce the mixture with ratio (1 : 1 : 1), i.e., the mixture with equal parts A, B and C. \nWe can verify that E(1) = 103, E(2) = 520447, E(10)\u00a0mod\u00a0118 = 82608406 and E(500)\u00a0mod\u00a0118 = 13801403.\nFind E(10\u00a0000\u00a0000)\u00a0mod\u00a0118.",

Let S(k) represent chef #k's skill level (which is publicly known). More specifically, S(k) is the probability that chef #k's dish will be assessed favorably by the judges (on any/all turns). If the dish receives a favorable rating, then the chef must choose one other chef to be eliminated from the competition. The last chef remaining in the competition is the winner.\nThe game always begins with chef #1, with the turn order iterating sequentially over the rest of the chefs still in play. Then the cycle repeats from the lowest-numbered chef. All chefs aim to optimize their chances of winning within the rules as stated, assuming that the other chefs behave in the same manner. In the event that a chef has more than one equally-optimal elimination choice, assume that the chosen chef is always the one with the next-closest turn.\nDefine Wn(k) as the probability that chef #k wins in a competition with n chefs.

The objective of the game is to move all of the disks from the leftmost rod to the rightmost rod, given the following restrictions:\nOnly one disk can be moved at a time.\nA valid move consists of taking the top disk from one stack and placing it onto another stack (or an empty rod).\nNo disk can be placed on top of a smaller disk.\nMoving on to a variant of this game, consider a long room k units (square tiles) wide, labeled from 1 to k in ascending order. Three rods are placed at squares a, b, and c, and a stack of n disks is placed on the rod at square a.\nBob begins the game standing at square b. His objective is to play the Tower of Hanoi game by moving all of the disks to the rod at square c. However, Bob can only pick up or set down a disk if he is on the same square as the rod / stack in question.\nUnfortunately, Bob is also drunk. On a given move, Bob will either stumble one square to the left or one square to the right with equal probability, unless Bob is at either end of the room, in which case he can only move in one direction. Despite Bob's inebriated state, he is still capable of following the rules of the game itself, as well as choosing when to pick up or put down a disk.\nThe following animation depicts a side-view of a sample game for n = 3, k = 7, a = 2, b = 4, and c = 6:\n\nLet E(n,k,a,b,c) be the expected number of squares that Bob travels during a single optimally-played game.

Each floor would send power to the floor above it, with the top floor sending power back down to the bottom floor. That way, Hilbert could have the generator placed on any given floor (as he likes having the option) and have electricity flow freely throughout the entire hotel.\nUnfortunately, the contractors misinterpreted the schematics when they built the hotel. They informed Hilbert that each floor sends power to another floor at random, instead. This may compromise Hilbert's freedom to have the generator placed anywhere, since blackouts could occur on certain floors.\nFor example, consider a sample flow diagram for a three-story hotel:\n\nIf the generator were placed on the first floor, then every floor would receive power. But if it were placed on the second or third floors instead, then there would be a blackout on the first floor. Note that while a given floor can receive power from many other floors at once, it can only send power to one other floor.\nTo resolve the blackout concerns, Hilbert decided to have a minimal number of floors rewired. To rewire a floor is to change the floor it sends power to. In the sample diagram above, all possible blackouts can be avoided by rewiring the second floor to send power to the first floor instead of the third floor.\nLet F(n) be the sum of the minimum number of floor rewirings needed over all possible power-flow arrangements in a hotel of n floors.

Placed on a plane, the bots will start to move towards their selected bots in a straight line. In contrast, being placed on a ball, they will start to move along a geodesic as the shortest possible path. However, in both cases, whenever their target moves they will adjust their direction instantaneously to the new shortest possible path. All bots will move at the same speed after their simultaneous activation until each bot reaches its goal.\nNow Bob places n bots on the ball (with radius 1) equidistantly on a small circle with radius 0.999 and programs each of them to move toward the next nanobot sitting counterclockwise on that small circle. After activation, the bots move in a sort of spiral until they finally meet at one point on the ball.\nUsing three bots, Bob finds that every bot will draw a line of length 2.84, resulting in a total length of 8.52 for all three bots, each time rounded to two decimal places. The coloured ball looks like this:\n\nIn order to show off a little with his presents, Bob decides to use just enough bots to make sure that the line each bot draws is longer than 1000.

Allowing configurations to reappear in rotated or mirrored form, a total of 92 distinct configurations can be found for eight queens. The general case asks for the number of distinct ways of placing n queens on a n\u00d7n board, e.g. you can find 2 distinct configurations for n=4.\nLet's define a weak queen on a n\u00d7n board to be a piece which can move any number of squares if moved horizontally, but a maximum of n\u22121\u2212w squares if moved vertically or diagonally, 0\u2264w<n being the \"weakness factor\". For example, a weak queen on a n\u00d7n board with a weakness factor of w=1 located in the bottom row will not be able to threaten any square in the top row as the weak queen would need to move n\u22121 squares vertically or diagonally to get there, but may only move n\u22122 squares in these directions. In contrast, the weak queen is not handicapped horizontally, thus threatening every square in its own row, independently from its current position in that row.\nLet Q(n,w) be the number of ways n weak queens with weakness factor w can be placed on a n\u00d7n board so that no two queens threaten each other.

Unfortunately, the programming options of these robots are rather limited.  Each one can only process up to 25 identical rectangles of metal, which they can weld along either edge to produce a larger rectangle.  The only programmable variables are the number of rectangles to be processed (up to and including 25), and whether to weld the long or short edge.\nFor example, the first robot could be programmed to weld together 11 raw unit square plates to make a 11\u00d71 strip.  The next could take 10 of these 11\u00d71 strips, and weld them either to make a longer 110\u00d71 strip, or a 11\u00d710 rectangle.  Many, but not all, possible dimensions of  metal sheets can be constructed in this way.\nOne regular customer has a particularly unusual order.  He always demands that the finished product should have an exact area, and that the long side must not be more than 10\nLet M(n) be the minimal area that can be manufactured in exactly n variants with the longer edge not greater than 10\nFind \u2211_n=2^100 M(n).",

Its mission was to take advantage of a combination of incredible computational power and vast periods of time to discover the answer to life, the universe, and everything. Hence the resident cleaning robot, Leonhard, along with his housekeeping responsibilities, was built with a powerful computational matrix to ponder the meaning of life as he wanders through a massive 1000 by 1000 square grid of rooms. She goes on to explain that the rooms are numbered sequentially from left to right, row by row. So, for example, if Leonhard was wandering around a 5 by 5 grid then the rooms would be numbered in the following way.\n\n\nMany millenia ago Leonhard reported to Katharina to have found the answer and he is willing to share it with any life form who proves to be worthy of such knowledge.\nKatharina further explains that the designers of Leonhard were given instructions to program him with equal probability of remaining in the same room or travelling to an adjacent room. However, it was not clear to them if this meant (i) an equal probability being split equally between remaining in the room and the number of available routes, or, (ii) an equal probability (50\n\n(i) Probability of remaining related to number of exits\n(ii) Fixed 50\n\nThe records indicate that they decided to flip a coin. Heads would mean that the probability of remaining was dynamically related to the number of exits whereas tails would mean that they program Leonhard with a fixed 50\nKatharina suggests it should not be too challenging to determine that the probability of finding him in a square numbered room in a 5 by 5 grid after unfathomable periods of time would be approximately 0.177976190476 [12 d.p.].\nIn order to prove yourself worthy of visiting the great oracle you must calculate the probability of finding him in a square numbered room in the 1000 by 1000 lair in which he has been wandering.\n(Give your answer rounded to 12 decimal places)",

The description of the problem was as follows:\nIf people on your planet were to enter a very large room one by one, what will be the expected number of people in the room when you first find 3 people with Birthdays within 1 day from each other.\nThe description further instructed them to enter the answer into the device and send the drone into space again. Startled by this turn of events, the Wimwians consulted their best mathematicians. Each year on Wimwi has 10 days and the mathematicians assumed equally likely birthdays and ignored leap years (leap years in Wimwi have 11 days), and found 5.78688636 to be the required answer. As such, the Wimwians entered this answer and sent the drone back into space.\nAfter traveling light years away, the drone then landed on planet Joka. The same events ensued except this time, the numbers in the device had changed due to some unknown technical issues. The description read:\nIf people on your planet were to enter a very large room one by one, what will be the expected number of people in the room when you first find 3 people with Birthdays within 7 days from each other.\nWith a 100-day year on the planet, the Jokars (inhabitants of Joka) found the answer to be 8.48967364 (rounded to 8 decimal places because the device allowed only 8 places after the decimal point) assuming equally likely birthdays. They too entered the answer into the device and launched the drone into space again.\nThis time the drone landed on planet Earth. As before the numbers in the problem description had changed. It read:\nIf people on your planet were to enter a very large room one by one, what will be the expected number of people in the room when you first find 4 people with Birthdays within 7 days from each other.\nWhat would be the answer (rounded to eight places after the decimal point) the people of Earth have to enter into the device for a year with 365 days?

The game starts as normal with both dropping a stick simultaneously on the upstream side of a bridge. But rather than the game ending when one of the sticks emerges on the downstream side, instead they fish their sticks out of the water, and drop them back in again on the upstream side. The game only ends when one of the sticks emerges from under the bridge ahead of the other one having also 'lapped' the other stick - that is, having made one additional journey under the bridge compared to the other stick.\n\n\nOn a particular day when playing this game, the time taken for a stick to travel under the bridge varies between a minimum of 30 seconds, and a maximum of 60 seconds. The time taken to fish a stick out of the water and drop it back in again on the other side is 5 seconds. The current under the bridge has the unusual property that the sticks' journey time is always an integral number of seconds, and it is equally likely to emerge at any of the possible times between 30 and 60 seconds (inclusive). It turns out that under these circumstances, the expected time for playing a single game is 1036.15 seconds (rounded to 2 decimal places). This time is measured from the point of dropping the sticks for the first time, to the point where the winning stick emerges from under the bridge having lapped the other.\n\n\nThe stream flows at different rates each day, but maintains the property that the journey time in seconds is equally distributed amongst the integers from a minimum, n, to a maximum, m, inclusive. Let the expected time of play in seconds be E(m,n). Hence E(60,30)=1036.15...\n\n\nLet S(k)=\u2211_m=2^k\u2211_n=1^m-1E(m,n).\n\n\nFor example S(5)=7722.82 rounded to 2 decimal places.\n\n\nFind S(100) and give your answer rounded to 2 decimal places.",

(In reality, a bump is awarded as soon as physical contact is made, which usually occurs when there is much less than a full boat length's overlap.)\n\n\nSuppose that, in a particular race, each boat B_j rows at a steady speed v_j = -logX_j metres per second, where the X_j are chosen randomly (with uniform distribution) between 0 and 1, independently from one another. These speeds are relative to the riverbank: you may disregard the flow of the river.\n\n\nLet p(n,L) be the probability that the new order is an even permutation of the starting order, when there are n boats in the division and L is the course length.\n\n\nFor example, with n=3 and L=160, labelling the boats as A,B,C in starting order with C highest, the different possible outcomes of the race are as follows:\n\n Bumps occurring \n New order \n Permutation \n Probability \n none \n A, B, C \n even \n 4/15B bumps CA, C, B \n odd \n 8/45A bumps BB, A, C \n odd \n 1/3B bumps C, then A bumps CC, A, B \n even \n 4/27A bumps B, then B bumps CC, B, A \n odd \n 2/27 \n\nTherefore, p(3,160) = 4/15 + 4/27 = 56/135.\n\n\nYou are also given that p(4,400)=0.5107843137, rounded to 10 digits after the decimal point.\n\n\nFind p(13,1800) rounded to 10 digits after the decimal point.",

It is based on lambda-terms, a minimal programming language featuring only function definitions, function calls and variables. Lambda-terms are built according to the following rules:\nAny variable x (single letter, from some infinite alphabet) is a lambda-term.\nIf M and N are lambda-terms, then (M N) is a lambda-term, called the application of M to N.\nIf x is a variable and M is a term, then (\u03bb x. M) is a lambda-term, called an abstraction. An abstraction defines an anonymous function, taking x as parameter and sending back M.\nA lambda-term T is said to be closed if for all variables x, all occurrences of x within T are contained within some abstraction (\u03bb x. M) in T. The smallest such abstraction is said to bind the occurrence of the variable x. In other words, a lambda-term is closed if all its variables are bound to parameters of enclosing functions definitions. For example, the term (\u03bb x. x) is closed, while the term (\u03bb x. (x y)) is not because y is not bound.\nAlso, we can rename variables as long as no binding abstraction changes. This means that (\u03bb x. x) and (\u03bb y. y) should be considered equivalent since we merely renamed a parameter. Two terms equivalent modulo such renaming are called \u03b1-equivalent. Note that (\u03bb x. (\u03bb y. (x y))) and (\u03bb x. (\u03bb x. (x x))) are not \u03b1-equivalent, since the abstraction binding the first variable was the outer one and becomes the inner one. However, (\u03bb x. (\u03bb y. (x y))) and (\u03bb y. (\u03bb x.

Then, for 2< j< N, counting from the west, the gap between the (j-1)th and jth marbles, as measured from their closest points, is given by (r_j  1000) + 1 millimetres.\nFurthermore, the jth marble is initially moving eastward if r_j < 10 000 000, and westward if r_j > 10 000 000.\nFor example, with N=3, the sequence specifies gaps of 117, 432, and 173 millimetres. The marbles' centres are therefore 127, 579, and 772 millimetres from the sealed west end of the tube. The west-most marble initially moves eastward, while the other two initially move westward.\nUnder this setup, and with a five metre tube (L=5000), it turns out that the middle (second) marble travels 5519 millimetres before its centre reaches the east-most end of the tube.\nLet d(L, N, j) be the distance in millimetres that the jth marble travels before its centre reaches the eastern end of the tube. So d(5000, 3, 2) = 5519. You are also given that d(10 000, 11, 6) = 11 780 and d(100 000, 101, 51) = 114 101.\nFind d(1 000 000 000, 1 000 001, 500 001).",
